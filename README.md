# Predictive-Analytics-to-Enhance-Delivery-Optimization
The project analyzes an ecommerce shipping dataset to identify the best model which predicts if the delivery was carried out on time or not. The aim is to improve logistics operations with the use of technological knowledge on machine learning.  

Project Overview:

Objective: The core idea of this research is to predict if shipment reached on time, with a focus on understanding the parameters that contribute to models which perform better.
